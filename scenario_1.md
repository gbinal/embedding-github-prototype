There's a page on www.howto.gov that only the site's webmaster can access, but they've asked for me to give them content for it.  

I want to maintain an unordered list in the body of that page.  Let's say of these websites:

* [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov)
* [Federal Communications Commission](http://www.fcc.gov)
* [Office of Personnel Management](http://www.gsa.gov)

BUT!  

I want to give them a snippet of code to put in the body of that page that will consume the text or code
