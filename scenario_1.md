There's a page on www.howto.gov that only the site's webmaster can access, but they've asked for me to give them content for it.  

I want to maintain an unordered list in the body of that page.  Let's say of these websites:

````
* [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov)
* [Federal Communications Commission](http://www.fcc.gov)
* [Office of Personnel Management](http://www.gsa.gov)
````


BUT!  

Instead of giving the webmaster the above, I want to give them a snippet of code to insert in its stead.  I would like to maintain the above list in GitHub, either as a data source or as html and have this snippet populate from this.  That way, when I have a future need to add a fourth website, I simply update the data source in GitHub and the webmaster does not need to even be involved in the update.
