==========================

## Background 
 
How can I start offering foolproof means of embedding text in 3rd pages pages that is pulled from a file in github?  

## Potential
* [Scenario 1](https://github.com/gbinal/embedding-github-prototype/blob/master/scenario_1.md)

## Criteria
* Code delivered to the webmaster should not require local dependencies (e.g., not asking them to install X in order for the snippet to work)
* Not an iframe
